## Benefits of Component Structure

1. **Modularity**: Each section is self-contained and reusable
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to update individual sections without affecting others
3. **Readability**: Main index file is clean and easy to understand
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different sections simultaneously
5. **Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation

## Usage

To include a component in any blade file:
```blade
@include('tutor.profile.components.component-name')
```

## Variables Required

All components expect the following variables to be available:
- `$tutor` - The tutor model instance
- `$kyc` - The tutor KYC information (optional)
- `$profile` - The tutor profile model instance (optional)

## Fixed Issues

1. **Edit Button**: Fixed the broken edit button in personal-info section that was missing its closing tag and icon
2. **CSS Organization**: Moved all styles to a separate component file
3. **JavaScript Organization**: Moved all scripts to a separate component file
4. **Section Headers**: Ensured all section headers have proper flexbox layout

## Notes

- All edit functionality remains intact and functional
- CSRF tokens are properly handled in the JavaScript
- Responsive design is maintained across all components
- All AJAX endpoints remain unchanged
